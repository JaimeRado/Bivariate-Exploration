# Bivariate-Exploration
Visualization Case Study about Diamonds

Udacity Unit Case Study to practice visualizations between two or more variables.

In this particular case, I want to construct a plot of the price against carat weight on bivariate_exploration.ipynb. So far so good. But my issue comes when I want to plot a logarithmic transformation on price distribution due to its very long tail. I need to gain intuition about it and don't know if I completed it right. Can someone help?

Furthermore, there is a second quiz to solve and don't know how to do it. 
QUIZ: "Price vs. Carat comment 2: Assuming that you put price on the y-axis and carat on the x-axis, the transformation should have changed the scatterplot from looking concave upwards (like an upwards-pointing bowl) to concave downards (like a downwards-pointing bowl). It would be nice to have a linear trend, wouldn't it? It turns out that the x, y, and z dimensions track a much more linear trend against price than carat does. Since carat is more recognizable a feature value, let's add a transformation to the x-axis to see the approximately linear trend. Since weight is proportional to volume, and since all the diamonds are cut in approximately the same way (round-cut), a cube-root transformation of carat should allow us to see an approximately linear trend."
